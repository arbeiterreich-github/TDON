Lore:

The 2nd Ottoman-Egyptian war was a disaster. Egyptian troops brutally defeated Ottoman forces, while the Ottoman Navy defected to the Egyptian side. While Britain wanted to intervene, pressure from France, Spain and Russia prevented him from doing it.

After the Convention of Lugano, in 1940, Constantinople recognised full Egyptian independence and its control over the Levant and Hejaz. Soon after, a civil war broke out within the Empire, between radical reformers and conservatives; which was made worse when the Balkan Peoples (united under a common objective, freedom) revolted, and the Mamluks of Iraq were convinced by Muhammad Ali to declare independence for further development.

This would, by 1846, made the Ottoman Empire a rump state in Anatolia, a shadow of its former self.

Just two years after that, the Revolutions of 1848 broke out across Europe:

The monarchies of Spain and France were ousted, and progressive-republican governments were put in place. In the east, Hungary revolted against Habsburg rule, and even Vienna itself revolted against tyranny. With Russia preocupied with its own rebellions (simultaneously, in Central Asia by Kazakhs and in the Caucasus by various groups), the Habsburg government was forced to recognize Hungarian independence and reform itself into a constitutional monarchy.

At the same time, Prussia rejected the crown of a unified germany, which led to the Revolutionaries offering the crown to Ferdinand I, which led to a partial german unification: Austria, Bavaria, Baden, Württemberg, and some minor states.

The so-called "German War" of 1856 would see a Prussian-led north-german alliance get crushed by the German Empire, while Italy, supported by France, managed to "liberate" Venice from the Germans.

In North America, the American Civil war would see the great USA get divided between a "rump" USA, the CSA, the State of Deseret (a mormon country) and the Pacific States (a mixed hispanic-english federation of states). British support for the CSA proved essential, which made the CSA really close with Britain.

It was only in 1866 that the United Kingdom of Northern Italy managed to unify the Italian Peninsula, forming the Italian Kingdom, a progressive constitutional monarchy. Soon after, a friendship alliance was signed with France.

In 1869, the Suez Canal was opened in Egypt, jointly controlled by France and Spain.

The "Mediterranean Pact", between Egypt, France, Spain and Italy was formalised in 1870, antagonizing British imperialism and Russian interests in the Middle East.

The next decades would see the deepening of European colonialism in Asia, with the Great Qing being forced to cede territories to Russia, Britain, France and Spain with the enacting of Unequal Treties, while the African continent remained relatively unexplored until 1890s. Two main factors opened Africa to colonisation:

In 1885, Egyptian forces conquering Equatoria arrived to the Great Lakes, and rumors about its riches spread across the Nile reached european governments.

In 1893, Spanish historian and explorer Cánovas del Castillo accompained Zanzibari slaveowner, and (self-appointed) governor of the Congo, Tippu Tip, across Africa, being the first European to travel across Africa from Zanzibar to the mouth of the Congo River.

Reporting the natural riches and potential mineral deposit, this would inspire a renewed effort on colonising a new continent, which would still by the 1900 to be fairly unknown.

By this day, the world is divided between two blocs: the Mediterranean Pact and its allies, and the Moscow Accord and its own allies.
